## Key Features

- **ACRN Protocol Implementation:** The core functionality of the application lies in its implementation of the Acoustic Coordinated Reset Neuromodulation (ACRN) protocol. ACRN is a non-invasive auditory stimulation technique that generates synchronous, zero-phase, and low-amplitude 'anti-phase' signals to suppress tinnitus. Studies have shown it to be a promising approach in providing temporary relief from tinnitus symptoms.

- **Built-in Kindling Effect:** The application innovatively includes a "kindling" feature. In the context of tinnitus, 'kindling' refers to the gradual increase in the period it takes for tinnitus to return after relief. This application emulates this process – after approximately 20 loops, the delay intervals between the sound patterns start to extend, culminating in a final delay set at 10 seconds by default. This approach provides a more natural, organic experience in line with the fluctuating nature of tinnitus symptoms.

- **Customizable Audio Device Selection:** ACRN Tinnitus Protocol v1 introduces the convenience of audio device selection via a combo box. This feature significantly simplifies the user experience on Windows systems, bypassing the need to open the sound devices panel or navigate the control panel while working.

- **Free, Accessible, and User-Friendly:** This application stands against the tide of costly, premium-featured healthcare apps and predatory subscription services. It is a user-centric solution that provides relief without financial constraints or cumbersome accessibility. It is, and will always remain, free.
